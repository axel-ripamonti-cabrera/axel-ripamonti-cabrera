# Hey there! 👋

I’m **Axel RC**, a passionate gamer 🎮 and a computer science student 💻. My journey into tech started with my love for video games, and it quickly grew into a full-blown passion for programming, game development, and everything in between.

## A bit about me:

- 🏫 **Student:** I am currently studying in a computer science school and I am looking for a 2-year apprenticeship.
- 🎮 **Gaming Obsessed:** Whether it's the latest AAA release or a hidden indie gem, I’m always down to explore new worlds and mechanics. Gaming isn’t just a hobby—it’s an inspiration for my work.  
- 💻 **Code Enthusiast:** From Python and Java to web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I love building things from scratch and solving complex problems.  
- 🌱 **Always Learning:** Whether it’s picking up a new programming language, experimenting with game engines, or diving into AI and machine learning, I’m all about leveling up my skills.  
- 🚀 **Future Goals:** I dream of combining my love for games and tech to create projects that are innovative, immersive, and just plain fun.
